- Completes a first feature-complete.
- This version but it uses exceptions to validate errors which neglects
  the real message or purpose of the validation, and when a true exception
  is raised, it is completely hidden. 

  A tagged version with name 'handle-exceptions' will be created to keep
  this code. 

  Next is to not use exceptions.
